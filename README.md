FoodTinder is an innovative platform designed to make meal discovery and preparation effortless. It addresses the challenges of indecision, lack of inspiration, and fragmented recipe-sharing experiences by providing a comprehensive solution for food enthusiasts. 

## Problem Statement

Many people struggle to decide what to eat, limiting their ability to explore new dishes and discouraging them from cooking. Existing platforms might suggest food ideas but often lack detailed, step-by-step instructions for preparation. Social media platforms like TikTok offer inspiration but do not provide an integrated, all-in-one solution where users can save, filter, or share recipes seamlessly.
